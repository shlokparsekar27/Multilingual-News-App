## How to Set Up and Use

To run ZapNews locally, you'll need a PHP environment to host the proxy script.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ZapNews
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Obtain a Gemini API Key:**
    * Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or Google Cloud Console.
    * Generate a new API key for the Gemini API.

3.  **Configure the PHP Proxy:**
    * Create a file named `config.php` in the root of your project.
    * Open `config.php` and add your Gemini API key:
        ```php
        <?php
        $apiKey = 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY'; // Replace with your actual API key
        ?>
        ```
    * Ensure that `config.php` is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of your API key.

4.  **Start a PHP Development Server:**
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the root directory of the cloned project (where `index.html` and `gemini_proxy.php` are located).
    * Start the PHP built-in web server:
        ```bash
        php -S localhost:8000
        ```
        (You can use a different port if 8000 is occupied, e.g., `localhost:8080`).

5.  **Access the Application:**
    * Open your web browser.
    * Go to `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (or the port you chose).

6.  **Use the App:**
    * Browse news categories and languages.
    * Select a news channel to view the latest articles.
    * Click the "Summarize" button on any news article to get an AI-generated summary on a new page.
    * On the summary page, click the "Translate" button to open the summary in Google Translate.
    * Toggle the theme using the ‚òÄÔ∏è/üåô button in the top right.
